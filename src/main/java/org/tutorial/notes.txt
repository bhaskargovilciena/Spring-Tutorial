to create a bean in spring, we need to define the ApplicationContext object.
this object is created by using ClassPathXMLApplicationContext.
we use the context and call the .getBean() on that context.
but still the object won't be created.

we also need to specify in a separate XML file about this file creation. the name of the file can
be anything and that file is created in the resources directory which is present by default inside the main package.
in that file we define <beans> and in that we define every bean with a unique id and a class.
class is basically the exact package name of the class whose object has to be created like com.tutorial.Developer.

we also need to get the config for the beans tag. this can be found by googling "spring xml beans config". from that,
copy paste the XML code in XML file and the beans will be created.


BEANS
one thing to note about beans is that beans are created by default. the number of beans mentioned in the beans tag
will be created in the IOC container. beans are basically the object created in the IOC container that can be used
anywhere in the project. kind of like global object
